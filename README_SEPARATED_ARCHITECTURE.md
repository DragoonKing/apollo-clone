# Apollo247 Clone - Separated Client-Server Architecture

## ✅ Successfully Completed

The Apollo247 clone has been restructured into independent frontend and backend applications that can be developed separately while maintaining all existing functionality.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend (Express Server)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (12 doctors currently stored)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Server health check
  - `GET /api/list-doctor-with-filter` - Filtered doctor listing
  - `POST /api/add-doctor` - Add new doctor

### Frontend (React Client)
- **Port**: 5173 (development)
- **Technology**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Proxy**: API calls proxied to backend during development
- **Environment**: Configurable backend URL via `VITE_API_URL`

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Option 1: Concurrent Development (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts both client and server
```

### Option 2: Independent Development

#### Backend Only
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
- Standalone Express server on port 5000
- Full API functionality available
- Real MongoDB data (12 doctors)

#### Frontend Only
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
- React development server on port 5173
- Proxies API calls to backend
- Hot reload enabled

## 📊 Verified Functionality

### ✅ Server Status
- Server running on http://localhost:5000
- Health check: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-06-18T06:42:47.470Z"}`
- Database connected with real doctor data

### ✅ API Endpoints Working
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Get doctors with filters
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/list-doctor-with-filter?page=1&limit=5"
```

### ✅ Real Data Preserved
- 12 doctors currently in MongoDB
- Full filtering by name, specialty, city, gender, experience, rating
- Professional medical UI maintained
- Add doctor functionality intact

```

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

### Backend Package (`server/package.json`)
- Express, CORS, MongoDB dependencies
- TypeScript development setup
- Independent build and dev scripts

### Frontend Package (`client/package.json`)
- React, Vite, Tailwind dependencies
- Proxy configuration for API calls
- Hot reload development setup

### Environment Configuration
- `client/.env`: API URL configuration
- `client/vite.config.ts`: Proxy settings
- TypeScript path mapping for shared schemas

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Independent Development**: Teams can work on frontend/backend separately
2. **Hot Reload**: Both client and server support live reloading
3. **Type Safety**: Shared schemas ensure consistency
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Can deploy to different services
5. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
6. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved

## 📱 Application Features (Preserved)

- ✅ Professional Apollo247-style UI
- ✅ Real-time doctor search and filtering
- ✅ Add new doctors with validation
- ✅ MongoDB data persistence
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ SEO optimization
- ✅ Form validation with Zod schemas

The application now supports modern development workflows while maintaining the complete healthcare platform functionality for interview demonstrations.
